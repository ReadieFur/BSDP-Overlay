# About
## What is this?  
BSDP Overlay is an overlay that can be used with the DataPuller mod for BeatSaber.  
It takes the data outputted by the game and displays it for you, the user to overlay on your recordings/streams.  
## Why is this special?  
There are other overlays out there, so what makes this one special?  
Well aside from the default overlay that has been out since May 25, 2020, this webapp allows you to create your own overlays without needing to know how to code!  
## How do I use this?  
You don't need an account to use the public overlays, but if you want to make your own overlays then you will need to make an account.  
To get started with creating overlays, first make sure you have an account. You can create an account by going to `account > managment`.  
Once you have an account you can create up to 10 overlays, either public or private.  
To create a new overlay, just open the editor.  
To edit your existing overlays, find it in the browser by using the search filter `username:<YOUR_USERNAME_HERE>`, click on the desired overlay and then press `edit`.  
To use public overlays by others, just click on the desired overlay from the browser and then press `use overlay`.  
## What's to come:
This webapp is still very new and there should be a lot of changes to come in the future, some things inclue:  
- Block like scripting for events in the game
- Custom CSS
- New elements
- And much more!

I'm always open to new ideas and sugguestions, so if you feel like something could be added or improved feel free to drop me a message on Github or Discord.
