I should've made this file sooner, I guess that is why Github is there to track changes.
Try to figure out how to link files in here.

Todo:
    ☐ add more elements
    ☐ prevent elements from being scaled outside the UI
    ☐ fix text property editor updates being delayed by 1 change
    ☐ make element border red when 'control' and 'alt' are pressed
    ☐ add "clipboard memory"? undo/redo/cut/copy/paste.
    ☐ add sample data/game data toggle.
    ☐ fix thumbnail scaling:
        ☐ short term solution: create thumbnail at the editor resolution and then resize the image to 480p
        ☐ long term solution: change the editor so that all overlays are the same resolution and then the overlay is scaled appropriately)
    Optional:
        ☐ add block like scripting
