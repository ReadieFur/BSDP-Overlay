What do you want to accomplish with the closed release?
A release that is easy enough for a normal user to use and work around but its ok to have a few issues here and there, missing features etc

Todo:
    Dev release:
        Subject 1:
            Closed release:
                ✔ But say the editor resizing: currently, if someone were to shrink their browser down to, say, reference something while working, it may turn out different when they do to use it @done(21-06-27 20:25)
                ✔ Clicking on the elements once doesn't do anything, nor does drag and drop, so the user may think something is broken or that adding an element is more difficult than it is @done(21-06-25 21:32) (walkthrough menu created)
            ☐ The buttons in the top right of the splash page will go underneath the site logo (top left) at smaller widths (even half screen) (not sure what is meant by this)
            ✘ Double click to add an item is relatively unintuitive. Perhaps try a single click or drag system. If you like the safety, maybe add a small instruction at the top. @cancelled(21-06-28 14:36)
            ✔ Arrow key "pixel shifting" for elements. @done(21-06-28 15:41)
            ☐ A snapping system for objects (pretty difficult sounding, tbh)
            ✔ Add a back button for the menu bar (not sure what is meant by this), and add a delay to the auto-collapse. Its super easy for the user to slip their cursor off of the bar when acting fast, which requires them to press the button again @done(21-06-25 18:03)
            ✔ Add a loading animation to the loading screen. This helps reassure the user that there is something happening. @done(21-06-25 19:07)
            ☐ Perhaps give the bars (time, acc, etc) a default label, with a toggle to disable. This helps provide more natural context for exactly what appeared on screen.
            ✘ Cap the cover-size or increase the image resolution. This prevents the user from resizing into a pixelated mess. @cancelled(21-06-28 14:52) This is just to do with the resolution of the base image.
            ✘ I think you should lock the editor to 16:9 now, so that the user can be sure that where they place the elements in the editor are where it will appear @cancelled(21-06-27 20:25)
            ✘ You should try making the menu collapsable @cancelled(21-06-28 14:51)
        Subject 2:
            ✔ hey, the position of an element is not correct when dragging an element around, but that only happens on 1080p+ resolutions. this may be because of the scale factor, perhaps a way to fix this is to calculate how many pixels the user has moved and apply the scale to that movment. @done(21-07-12 21:26)
            ☐ text tooltip also has the weird offset on higher resolutions. hard to recreate this issue
            ✔ scroll bar idle colour is hard to see @done(21-07-12 21:36)

    Closed release:
        ☐ Elements are not loaded in the correct order. (Partially complete).

    Public release:
        ☐ Fix the UI IP changer (then make the URL IP an override).
        ☐ Create the settings menu instead of passing options in through the URL.
        ☐ Odd issue with scaled UIs on firefox when dragging elements around.
        ☐ clean up the editor file.
        ☐ fix the border around the scaled elements in the overlay.
        ☐ fix the radio button positioning.
        ☐ add overlay details to the preview page.
        ☐ create the home page video.
        ☐ add more elements.
        ☐ add modifer elements.
        ☐ prevent elements from being scaled outside the UI.
        ☐ fix text property editor updates being delayed by 1 change.
        ☐ add text alignment (currently fixed to the side of the overlay it is on).
        ☐ sort out the protocol to load (http/https) when an external IP is specified.
        ☐ fix the small spacing gap in the editor table.
        ☐ add percentage alignments.
        ☐ add align center for horizontal/vertical within the parent.
        ☐ fix the element initial alignment option in the menu.
        ☐ allow the user to change the z-position of the elements.
        ☐ enable background toggle on the bar elements.
        ☐ add a toggle to the bar elements to the text.
        ☐ fix the bar elements initial value being 100%.
        ☐ add some browser specific features (styles).
    
    Optional:
        ☐ Convert all colours to HSL.
        ☐ add a rotation option.
        ☐ add block like scripting (e.g. do x on y).
        ☐ add "clipboard memory"? undo/redo/cut/copy/paste.
        ☐ add an element expand menu to view more at once.
        ☐ nest/group elements.
        ☐ round bar direction toggle.
        ☐ round bar time element count down.
        ☐ what would be better for element customisation is to read the options from the script instead of having them hard coded into the php file.
