Todo:
    Closed release:
        ☐ create a 'how to' tutorial.
        ☐ add sample data/game data toggle.
        ☐ create the home page video.
        ☐ disable the editor elements listing from being affected by the game data.
        ☐ sync the data displayed with that in the element preview.
        the two above should be made as one change set to a 'preview' toggle that has the sample data and game data enabled when checked and then the placeholder text when disabled.

    Public release:
        ☐ add more elements.
        ☐ prevent elements from being scaled outside the UI.
        ☐ fix text property editor updates being delayed by 1 change.
        ☐ fix the preview generation on firefox.
        ☐ add a rotation option.
        ☐ add text alignment (currently fixed to the side of the overlay it is on).
        ☐ sort out the protocol to load (http/https) when an external IP is specified.
        ☐ fix the small spacing gap in the editor table.
        ☐ add percentage alignments.
        ☐ add align center for horizontal/vertical within the parent.
        ☐ fix the element initial alignment option in the menu.
        ☐ change zoom to scale + transform-origin.
        ☐ allow the user to change the z-position of the elements.
        ☐ enable background toggle on the bar elements.
        ☐ fix thumbnail scaling:
            ☐ short term solution: create thumbnail at the editor resolution and then resize the image to 480p
            ☐ long term solution: change the editor so that all overlays are the same resolution and then the overlay is scaled appropriately)
    
    Optional:
        ☐ add block like scripting (e.g. do x on y).
        ☐ add "clipboard memory"? undo/redo/cut/copy/paste.
        ☐ add an element expand menu to view more at once.
        ☐ nest/group elements.
        ☐ add the beatsaber background to the browser previews?
        ☐ round bar direction toggle.
