# BSDP-Overlay
## Access the tool [here.](https://readie.global-gaming.co/bsdp-overlay/)
**Please Note:** that this tool is still in early acces and it is highly likley that there are many bugs that exist, the tool is not complete yet and there should be much more to come in the future.

## What is this?  
BSDP Overlay is an overlay that can be used with the DataPuller mod for BeatSaber.  
It takes the data outputted by the game and displays it for you, the user to overlay on your recordings/streams. 

## Why is this special?  
There are other overlays out there, so what makes this one special?  
Well aside from the default overlay that has been out since May 25, 2020, this webapp allows you to create your own overlays without needing to know how to code!  

## What's to come:
This webapp is still very new and there should be a lot of changes to come in the future, some things inclue:  
- Block like scripting for events in the game
- Custom CSS
- New elements
- And much more!

## Here are some examples of the webapp in action:
